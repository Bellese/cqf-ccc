# Colorectal Cancer Concepts

An example FHIR artifact library that illustrates a CPG-on-FHIR approach to
knowledge engineering applied to Colorectal Cancer.

The concepts in this artifact library are extracted from the FHIR translation of the
currently published Colorectal Cancer Screening electronic Clinical Quality Measure (eCQM),
CMS-130. The concepts were abstracted and expressed using CPG-on-FHIR profiles and
approaches, with the goal of illustrating how shareable libraries of clinical knowledge
can be used in various domains including quality measurement, decision support, case-reporting,
and others.
